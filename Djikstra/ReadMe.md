# Path Planning with Djikstra
This repository has code files for navigation of point robot and rigid robots using Dijkstra algorithm. 

## Getting Started
A python 3 environment is required to run the codes.The program will prompt you for its run parameters which are the start and the end goal coordinates.
When you have finished with the parameters, the program will run.

## Prerequisites
The programs uses numpy, pygame and math libraries. Hence, these libraries should be pre-installed. 
## Running the programs
1.  Open Terminal 
2.  Navigate to the extraced folder or git clone from the repo
3.  Run the command for the python program
    - ```python pointRobot.py``` for Point Robot
    - ```python rigidRobot.py``` for Rigid Robot
